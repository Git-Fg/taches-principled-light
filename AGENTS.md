# Taches Principled

You have both **superpowers** and **taches-principled-light** installed. They are designed to coexist.

## How They Fit Together

- **superpowers** is your foundation — brainstorming, TDD, systematic debugging, code review, git worktrees, verification, plan execution, skill writing.
- **taches-principled-light** adds specialist skills — DDD, first-principles reasoning, structured agent-driven dev, Rust, MCP, security, wiki, session analytics.

## When Both Cover a Topic

Each taches skill has a CONTRAST section. When a topic overlaps with superpowers, the skill redirects explicitly. Examples:

- Want Red-Green-Refactor TDD? → superpowers' `test-driven-development` (taches' `test-orchestration` handles strategy and repair only)
- Want to brainstorm a vague idea into a design? → superpowers' `brainstorming` (taches' `ideation` generates alternatives only)
- Want root-cause debugging? → superpowers' `systematic-debugging`
- Want per-task subagent execution? → superpowers' `subagent-driven-development` (taches' `sadd` does competitive generation)
- Want collaborative skill creation? → superpowers' `writing-skills` (taches' `skill-authoring` optimizes routing only)

**The pattern: superpowers for fundamentals, taches-principled-light for depth.**

## Subagent Convention

All skills use platform-agnostic phrasing. Never name a specific tool.

### Explorer (read-only)

```
spawn a subagent explorer with the prompt:
  "<task>"
  Read-only. Return findings as a bounded summary.
```

Use for: codebase mapping, external research, wiki search, verification reads.

### Generalist (edit access)

```
spawn a subagent generalist with the prompt:
  "<task>"
  You have edit access. Implement, verify, return what you changed.
```

Use for: implementation, review, judgment, auditing, fixes.

## Adding a Skill

1. Create `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` with frontmatter + body.
2. Follow `skill-authoring` METHODOLOGY mode for routing.
3. No other files to touch.
