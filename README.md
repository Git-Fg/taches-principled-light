# Taches Principled

**Version:** 0.0.8 · 26 top-level skills (5 design-hub sub-skills = 31 SKILL.md total)

A specialist plugin for Claude Code, Kimi Code, Codex, and Cursor. Pairs with [superpowers](https://github.com/GoFaster/superpowers) for the complete development toolkit.

## Superpowers + Taches Principled

Install both. They're designed to coexist:

| Layer | Plugin | Role |
|-------|--------|------|
| **Foundation** | superpowers | Brainstorming, TDD, systematic debugging, code review, git worktrees, verification, plan execution, skill writing |
| **Specialist** | taches-principled-light | DDD, first-principles reasoning, structured agent-driven dev, Rust lifecycle, MCP expertise, security audit, wiki management, session analytics, full task lifecycle |

Skills know about each other. Taches skills redirect to superpowers when they overlap — every skill with adjacent-domain overlap has a CONTRAST section pointing to the superpowers equivalent.

## What's New in 0.0.8

**Repo finalization (eval cleanup + sanitization).** No new skills; no new behavioral data; no breaking changes. Patch-level release that **scrubs personally-identifying and vendor-specific information** from in-repo docs, **consolidates 5 superseded eval iterations + 2 executed plans + 2 design specs + 13 intermediate research work products** (~13 MB) into a single canonical narrative in [`docs/principled/skill-evals/ITERATION-PHASE-RETROSPECTIVE.md`](docs/principled/skill-evals/ITERATION-PHASE-RETROSPECTIVE.md), and **removes the v0.0.7 release-gate CI** (`.github/workflows/eval-regression.yml` + `release-gate.py`). All 4 plugin manifests synchronized to 0.0.8. Active tree at ~2.4 MB; closure archive at `docs/principled/attic/2026-06-23-closure/` (~2.2 MB). **`iter-7` remains the canonical headline** (+21.88pp total_lift, 4/4 lifts, 0 hurts). See CHANGELOG for the long-form breakdown and the closure archive's `STATUS.md` for the full closure record.

## What's New in 0.0.7

**Iteration phase closure marker (repo finalization).** No new skills; no breaking changes; no new behavioral data. Patch-level release that archives ~13 MB of historical artifacts into `docs/principled/attic/2026-06-23-closure/` with `STATUS.md` + `metadata.md` per the AGENTS.md "Project Closure Convention." Active tree shrank from 15 MB → 2.4 MB (84% reduction). **`iter-7` remains the canonical headline** (+21.88pp total_lift, 4/4 lifts, 0 hurts, deterministic endpoint grades). All 4 plugin manifests synchronized to 0.0.7. iter-8 forward-looking plan preserved in the active tree, awaiting LiteLLM multi-family proxy deployment that unblocks iter-6 vendor-disjoint validation. See CHANGELOG for the long-form breakdown and the closure archive's `STATUS.md` for the full closure record.

## What's New in 0.0.6

**Post-v0.0.5 polish, iter-8 design, and citation audit.** No new skills; no breaking changes; 19 commits, 35 files changed (+1613/-7). Four areas of work: (1) **iter-8 design** — 286-line plan + 213-line design supplements note addressing the two open follow-ups from iter-7 (proxy is structurally single-family → vendor-disjoint validation blocked; sec-audit +17.5pp grader swing on identical transcripts). The iter-8 architecture is a two-layer MCP test-runner stack: a mock MCP server (Tyk / AIMock / custom) feeds captured golden responses to the agent, and **mcp-assert** (Go, MIT, 18 stars, 0 open issues) acts as the test runner that asserts YAML expectations. (2) **Citation hallucination remediation** — 4 fabricated arXiv IDs (2406.01574, 2602.12345, 2603.12345) replaced with verified real ones (Wataoka 2024 / CoEval 2026 / SkillRouter 2026), 1 fabricated Claude-on-Claude κ=0.770 number replaced with the actual JudgeBench κ=0.720 from Norman/Rivera/Hughes 2026 (arxiv:2606.19544). (3) **CI action bumps** — `actions/checkout` v4→v7, `actions/setup-python` v5→v6, `actions/upload-artifact` v4→v7 across both workflows. PR #1 (dependabot's auto-PR for these bumps) closed with an explanation comment; the local-application workflow is preferred for this repo. (4) **v0.0.5 self-critic pass** — 4 rounds of self-critic found 1 HIGH, 2 MEDIUM issues, all fixed. iter-8 design reviewed at 3 levels (PLAN.md ↔ supplements ↔ INDEX.md) for cross-reference integrity. See CHANGELOG for the long-form breakdown and the iter-8 supplements note for the MCP test-runner architecture detail.

## What's New in 0.0.5

**iter-5/6/7 measurement campaign complete.** Canonical headline from `evaluating-skills` 8-stage harness on the configured solver: **mean total_lift +21.88pp** across 4 evals (`eval-skill`, `sec-audit`, `lint-1`, `release-2`) — **4/4 lifts, 0 hurts, deterministic endpoint grades.** Three lifts disambiguated by introducing a true no-plugin baseline via `--disable-slash-commands`: `consultation_lift` = +8.12pp (noisy, +17.5pp grader swing on identical transcript), `filesystem_access_lift` = +13.75pp, `total_lift` = +21.88pp. iter-4's contaminated `without_skill` baseline (plugin auto-loads via `slash_commands` regardless of `--add-dir`) is corrected. iter-6 vendor-disjoint validation is structurally blocked by the single-family inference gateway (all 20+ tier aliases resolve to one configured backend; the only vendor-disjoint alias is rate-limited and returned 503 for all 12 grading cells). iter-5 (N=11 reliability) deferred — not ship-blocking because the +21.88pp headline is well above the grader noise floor. See [`docs/principled/skill-evals/ITERATION-PHASE-RETROSPECTIVE.md`](docs/principled/skill-evals/ITERATION-PHASE-RETROSPECTIVE.md) and CHANGELOG.

## What's New in 0.0.4

Iter-4 measurement infrastructure (combined `run_iteration_4.py` runner, subprocess timeout marker, stale cache invalidation documentation). iter-4's headline is +4.94pp on 18 evals (5 lifts / 13 neutrals / 0 hurts) — but the `without_skill` baseline was contaminated by the marketplace plugin auto-loading via `slash_commands`, so this is the **filesystem_access_lift only**, not the total lift. See CHANGELOG.

## What's New in 0.0.3

Behavior-eval-validated router improvements. Mean lift **+8.69pp** across 17 behavior evals (6 lifts / 11 neutrals / **0 hurts**) over the prior release. Six zero-discovery skills gained 5-10 trigger phrases each (Microsoft best-practices density); `ingesting-skills` and `marketplace-validator` rewritten with explicit scope routers. Iter-3 corrected evaluation pipeline added (`docs/principled/skill-evals/marketplace-routing-2026-06-22/iteration-3/`) — `grader.py` + `run_iteration_3.py` + corrected REPORT.md + BUCKET-A-INSPECTION + DISCOVERY-INVESTIGATION. Iter-3.1 per-skill `--add-dir` experiment in flight to confirm the plugin-shadowing hypothesis behind 5 Bucket A3 discovery failures. CHANGELOG has the long-form breakdown.

## What's New in 0.0.2

First post-alpha iteration. Routing precision improved from a vacuous `7W / 0T / 3L` (5-skill pool, broken regex) to a real `15W / 1T / 2L` (35-skill pool, fixed parser). Skill descriptions in `skills/*/SKILL.md` refactored to single-line YAML for max compatibility; 27 tightened to ≤50 words; 4 of 5 design-hub sub-skills gained negative triggers (design-principles pending). Parser hardened for single-quoted scalars and YAML 1.2 escape sequences. Behavioral eval harness validated with a pilot run — see CHANGELOG for the long-form breakdown.

## What's New in 0.0.1-alpha

First alpha cut. The 26 top-level skills are frozen as the public surface; everything else is internal tooling or pre-alpha history. See CHANGELOG for the long-form breakdown.
